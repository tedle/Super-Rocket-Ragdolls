FAQ:
----
Q: Why does the executable ask for admin priviledges?
A: This mod requires making changes to "Engine.dll", a file that is normally
located in the Program Files directory which is write-protected from regular
programs.

Q: What if Engine.dll becomes corrupted?
A: There should be a backup in the same folder called Engine.dll.bak

Huge thanks to Bman for creating the original Super/Lesser Flying Bodies mod for Titan Quest. This entire project was inspired by their fantastic idea.
