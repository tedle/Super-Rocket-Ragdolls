FAQ:
----
Q: Why does the executable ask for admin priviledges?
A: This mod requires making changes to "Engine.dll", a file that is normally
located in the Program Files directory which is write-protected from regular
programs.

Q: What if this mod corrupted Engine.dll?
A: There should be a backup in the same folder called Engine.dll.bak
