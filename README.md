##FAQ

###Why does the executable ask for admin priviledges?
This mod requires making changes to "Engine.dll", a file that is normally located in the Program Files directory which is write-protected from regular programs.

###What if Engine.dll becomes corrupted?
There should be a backup in the same folder called Engine.dll.bak
